# Audio Classification Model for Vehicle Identification

## Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop an advanced model for classifying vehicle types using audio files as input data. The model's primary objective is to accurately predict whether a given audio recording represents the sound of a car or a truck. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the model will analyze the audio features extracted from the files to make these predictions.

## Objective:

The primary goal is to accurately predict whether a given audio sample corresponds to a car or a truck. This capability has various practical applications, including traffic monitoring, vehicle detection, and urban planning.

     - Develop a machine learning model capable of classifying vehicle types (cars vs. trucks) using audio recordings.
     - Explore and extract relevant audio features that capture distinctive characteristics of car and truck sounds.
     - Train the model using a labeled dataset of audio files, ensuring robust performance across diverse sound environments.
     - Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance metrics to assess its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
     <!-- - Provide a user-friendly interface for utilizing the trained model, enabling easy integration into various applications and systems. -->

## Dataset:

### Dataset Description

The dataset comprises a collection of audio recordings capturing various vehicle sounds, accompanied by corresponding metadata stored in JSON format. Each entry in the dataset includes details such as the camera identifier (cam), classification probability (probs), class label indicating whether the sound belongs to a car or a truck (cls), timestamp (dto), and additional attributes.

### Metadata Attributes:

Camera Identifier (cam): Indicates the camera source of the audio recording.
Classification Probability (probs): Represents the probability of the classification result.
Class Label (cls): Specifies whether the sound corresponds to a car (class 2) or a truck (class 7).
Timestamp (dto): Denotes the date and time of the audio recording.
Other Fields: Additional attributes include intersection coordinates (intersection), bounding box coordinates (box), frame timestamp (frame_dto), sequence length (seq_len), and file paths for full and debug images.
Audio Files
The dataset includes audio files corresponding to each entry, stored in the specified paths under the snd field. These audio files capture the auditory signatures of vehicles, enabling the classification model to learn and distinguish between car and truck sounds.

### Usage

#### Training and Evaluation:

     The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for vehicle classification based on audio data.

#### Research and Development:

Researchers and developers can leverage the dataset to explore novel approaches for vehicle sound analysis and classification.

#### Real-world Applications:

The insights gained from this dataset can contribute to various applications, including traffic monitoring, urban planning, and surveillance systems.

## Model Architecture:

The model architecture likely involves deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These architectures excel in learning complex patterns from sequential data, making them suitable for audio classification tasks.

## Model Training:

The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, where it learns to associate the audio features with their corresponding vehicle classes. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the classification error, gradually improving its predictive accuracy.

## Model Evaluation:

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set of audio files. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying car and truck sounds.

## Usage:

The trained model can be deployed for practical applications requiring real-time vehicle classification. Users can input audio samples into the model, and it will output predictions indicating whether the sound corresponds to a car or a truck.

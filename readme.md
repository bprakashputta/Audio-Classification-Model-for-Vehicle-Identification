# Audio Classification Model for Vehicle Identification

## Overview:

This project aims to develop a model for classifying vehicle types using audio files as input data. The model's objective is to predict whether the sound corresponds to a car or a truck based on the audio features extracted from the files.

## Objective:

The primary goal is to accurately predict whether a given audio sample corresponds to a car or a truck. This capability has various practical applications, including traffic monitoring, vehicle detection, and urban planning.

## Dataset:

The dataset comprises audio files of different vehicle sounds, with corresponding class labels indicating whether the sound belongs to a car (class 2) or a truck (class 7). The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the model's performance.

## Model Architecture:

The model architecture likely involves deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These architectures excel in learning complex patterns from sequential data, making them suitable for audio classification tasks.

## Model Training:

The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, where it learns to associate the audio features with their corresponding vehicle classes. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the classification error, gradually improving its predictive accuracy.

## Model Evaluation:

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set of audio files. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying car and truck sounds.

## Usage:

The trained model can be deployed for practical applications requiring real-time vehicle classification. Users can input audio samples into the model, and it will output predictions indicating whether the sound corresponds to a car or a truck.
